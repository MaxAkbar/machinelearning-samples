Harvard's Matthew Bunn said the Belgian case highlights further steps that must be taken to thwart nuclear terrorism.

Pent-up democratic aspirations were unleashed this week in Myanmar's first free election in decades resulting in a landslide victory for Aung San Suu Kyi and her opposition party. But as Mark Famaner and Hanna Hindstrom point out it is democracy on a leash as the long-standing military rulers retain a constraining foothold through the current constitutional arrangement. It remains to be seen if Suu Kyi's elected government will be above those constraints as she has boldly asserted. Writing from Yangon Ma Thida lays out the many issues in the political transition ahead. Harrison Akins reminds us that the shadow over Myanmar's democratic turn is the continuing persecution and discrimination against the Muslim Rohingya minority. If it stabilizes Myanmar could have a bright future. It sits between the two fastest growing economies in the world India and China the second of which is revitalizing the ancient Silk Road trading route that George Yeo Singapore's former foreign minister sees as making Eurasia the driver of the future global economy.

BEIJING -- The title of Barack Obama's pre-presidential biography is The Audacity of Hope. Chinese President Xi Jinping has written his own document released this week -- The Communist Party's 13th five-year plan -- that might be titled The Audacity of the Chinese Dream. This blueprint for China's future signals the most momentous shift in direction since the death of Mao and Deng Xiaoping's reform and opening up in 1978. Not a leader to rest on the laurels of his country's remarkable success so far in rising to the top ranks of the global economy Xi wants to leap over the middle-income trap in which development becomes stuck in a low-wage manufacturing export economy. To do that he needs to avoid in his own words the Thucydides trap of conflict between China as a rising power and the U.S. as the established power so instability does not disrupt growth prospects.

Much to the chagrin of NATO Gulf countries and others Russia this week ramped up its military campaign in Syria in what has become a war with global implications.

Has Russian President Vladimir Putin succeeded in his oft-stated goal of reasserting Russia as a great global power by filling a geopolitical vacuum in Syria?

Ancient Greece was not only the birthplace of democracy but also a deathbed of reason when a jury of 500 citizens condemned Socrates to die by hemlock poisoning for his impious attitude toward the order of the day. Defiant to the end the philosopher voluntarily drank the poison himself in a suicidal display of dignity. This weekend Greek voters will decide in a referendum whether they will be force-fed more painful austerity imposed by the jury of other European democracies or like Socrates administer their own poison in a no vote that will likely push Greece out of the eurozone. Tragedy too such as we are witnessing today had its origins in early Greek drama. Nobel Laureate Joe Stiglitz and Martin Guzman argue that Greece will be better off administering the poison by its own hand.
